# Welcome to Neon Crash!

Neon Crash is a Tabletop RPG about **Transforming Heroes in a Futuristic City**. It draws inspiration from Animation and Japanese Live-Action (Tokusatsu) titles such as **Bubblegum Crisis**, **Batman Beyond**, **Kamen Rider**. Gameplay-wise, it is inspired directly by games like **Daggerheart**, **Fabula Ultima**, **ICON**, and games that are "**Illuminated by LUMEN**."

For a more in-depth explanation of the setting and to delve into the rules, please feel free to check out the [Neon Crash Wiki](../../wiki).

The "Code" section of this repository will hold the current released versions of the game in PDF and Markdown format, along with some .NET scripts that I'll probably be using for compiling the various pages into a final product.
